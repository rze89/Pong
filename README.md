A simple Pong game in which I aimed to test some of my knowledge of
the Java GUI. It was a fun project and I hope to post more projects
that involve the use of the GUI in the near future. When playing,
you will face off against the Computer AI. At the top left and 
top right of the screen, you will see the scores being tracked. To
end the game, just x out of the screen. Thanks for checking it out
and feel free to use the code, improve upon it, or notify me of 
some possible issues.
